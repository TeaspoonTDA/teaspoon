  abstract      = {The striking fractal geometry of strange attractors underscores the generative nature of chaos: like probability distributions, chaotic systems can be repeatedly measured to produce arbitrarily-detailed information about the underlying attractor. Chaotic systems thus pose a unique challenge to modern statistical learning techniques, while retaining quantifiable mathematical properties that make them controllable and interpretable as benchmarks. Here, we present a growing database currently comprising 131 known chaotic dynamical systems spanning fields such as astrophysics, climatology, and biochemistry. Each system is paired with precomputed multivariate and univariate time series. Our dataset has comparable scale to existing static time series databases; however, our systems can be re-integrated to produce additional datasets of arbitrary length and granularity. Our dataset is annotated with known mathematical properties of each system, and we perform feature analysis to broadly categorize the diverse dynamics present across the collection. Chaotic systems inherently challenge forecasting models, and across extensive benchmarks we correlate forecasting performance with the degree of chaos present. We also exploit the unique generative properties of our dataset in several proof-of-concept experiments: surrogate transfer learning to improve time series classification, importance sampling to accelerate model training, and benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms.},

Persistent topological Laplacians (PTLs) overcome some limitations of persistent homology, a key technique in TDA, and provide substantial insight to the behavior of various geometric and topological objects. This work extends PTLs to directed flag complexes, which are an exciting generalization to flag complexes, also known as clique complexes, that arise naturally in many situations. We introduce the directed flag Laplacian and show that the proposed persistent directed flag Laplacian (PDFL) is a distinct way of analyzing these flag complexes. Example calculations are provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed PDFL in real world applications.},

  abstract = {We establish a strong connection between Topological Data Analysis (TDA)and the field of time-series classification. This is accomplished via two novel contributions. The first is a method for extracting topological information from a timeseries in a manner which circumvents the expensive computation normally required. The second is an adaption of an existing topological summary to create an efficient topological time-series pooling operator. Taken together, these insights enable anew classifier, TopRocket (Topological Random Convolutional Kernel Transform).Using standard comparison methods, TopRocket ranks second among all univariate time-series classifiers. Further, TopRocket is the best performing scalable classifier. As a final contribution, we provide the fastest available implementation of the algorithm for computing time-series sublevel set persistence. This provides a foundation for further investigation of TDA for time-series classification.This work lies at the intersection of TDA and machine learning, where success is dependent on efficiently extracting topological information from data and using that information with downstream models. For this purpose, we develop an efficient, data-based, topological summary, the Betti pooling operator. We rigorously demonstrate the utility of TopRocket by evaluating its performance against the University of California Riverside (UCR) Time Series Archive, a widely used benchmark collection of data sets. TopRocket is the first TDA-based classifier to obtain state-of-the art results on any similarly competitive problem. We strongly believe that TDA will play a central role in the future of machine learning.},

  abstract = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is field that started only two decades ago and has already shown promise both in theory and in applications. The goal of TDA is to quantify the shape of data in a manner that is concise and robust using concepts from algebraic topology. Persistent homology, arguably the most popular tool from TDA, studies the shape of a filtered space by watching how its homology changes. The output of persistent homology is a persistence diagram, which encodes information about the changing homology. Persistent homology has shown success in various application areas; one ever growing area of study in this field is time series analysis. Nonlinear time series analysis is a research field in and of itself that aims to capture structure in time series data, however, it lacks theoretically justified tools to analyze the resulting structure. Persistent homology comes with a solid theoretical framework, is robust to noise, and quantifies the same type of structure as appears in time series data. Thus combining tools from time series analysis and TDA provides a new approach to analyze and quantify behavior in time series data. One field where time series are prevalent is dynamical systems, since a time series arises from a projection of a solution to a system. Specifically, given a time series, Takens' theorem can be leveraged to embed the time series as a point cloud in a higher dimensional space, where this point cloud is a sampling of the full state space. Then for each time series, persistent homology can be computed on the embedding. The result is a persistence diagram for each time series. The question then becomes how do we analyze this collection of persistence diagrams to learn something about the original time series data? Many people have developed methods to answer this question, through methods such as machine learning or statistics. This dissertation provides several new methods leveraging tools from both TDA and nonlinear time series analysis to study time varying data.},

  abstract      = {Persistence diagrams are common descriptors of the topological structure of data appearing in various classification and regression tasks. They can be generalized to Radon measures supported on the birth-death plane and endowed with an optimal transport distance. Examples of such measures are expectations of probability distributions on the space of persistence diagrams. In this paper, we develop methods for approximating continuous functions on the space of Radon measures supported on the birth-death plane, as well as their utilization in supervised learning tasks. Indeed, we show that any continuous function defined on a compact subset of the space of such measures (e.g., a classifier or regressor) can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomial combinations of features computed using a continuous compactly supported function on the birth-death plane (a template). We provide insights into the structure of relatively compact subsets of the space of Radon measures, and test our approximation methodology on various data sets and supervised learning tasks.},

In particular, it includes implementations of functions that, given some data, provide topological information about the underlying space, such as the distance function, the distance to a measure, the kNN density estimator, the kernel density estimator, and the kernel distance. The salient topological features of the sublevel sets (or superlevel sets) of these functions can be quantified with persistent homology. We provide an R interface for the efficient algorithms of the C++ libraries GUDHI, Dionysus and PHAT, including a function for the persistent homology of the Rips filtration, and one for the persistent homology of sublevel sets (or superlevel sets) of arbitrary functions evaluated over a grid of points. The significance of the features in the resulting persistence diagrams can be analyzed with functions that implement recently developed statistical methods. The R package TDA also includes the implementation of an algorithm for density clustering, which allows us to identify the spatial organization of the probability mass associated to a density function and visualize it by means of a dendrogram, the cluster tree.},

  abstract       = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is a collection of powerful tools that can quantify shape and structure in data in order to answer questions from the data's domain. This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.},
