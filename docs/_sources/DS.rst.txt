The `load_datasets` segment of the Machine Learning module is a set of datasets that are persistence diagrams computed from actual datasets used in machine learning applications.  Three datasets are available to load, and an accompanying notebook with a machine learning pipeline is available for each.  An additional dataset is available for download.  

An overview of these datasets is available in "`A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Methods for Persistence Diagrams <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.681174/full>`_" as well as details on the type of persistence used to compute persistence diagrams from each dataset.
