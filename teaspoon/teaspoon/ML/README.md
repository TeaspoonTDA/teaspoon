# teaspoon.ML

This code is for doing machine learning on persistence diagrams, in particular for classification and regression.  The main contribution is the featurization of persistence diagrams; all ML is done using `sklearn`.  

## Tents

The tents code, `tents.py` is the result of work from the following paper

- *Need to add the preprint info here*

An example to run is as follows.

- *Add some example code to get, say, the manifold experiment running*

## Carlsson coordinates

This code is coming soon as `CarlssonCoordinates.py` is currently empty..... It will consist of code for generating coordinates from the paper:
