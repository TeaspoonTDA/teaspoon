    """
    The EEG signal was taken from andrzejak et al. [1]_. Specifically, the first 5000 data points from the EEG data of a healthy patient from set A (file Z-093) was used and the first 5000 data points of a patient experiencing a seizure from set E (file S-056) was used (see figure below for case during seizure).

    .. figure:: ../../../figures/Human_Medical_Data/EEG_Data.png

    Parameters:
        SampleSize (Optional[int]): length of sample at end of entire time series
        dynamic_state (Optional[str]): Set dynamic state as either 'normal' or 'seizure'.

    Returns:
        array: Array of the time indices as `t` and the simulation time series `ts`
