Current Issues and To-do Items
*********************************************

This is a list of to do items:

	- Finish updating documentation
	- Get autodoc with sphinx to work
	- Make pip install-able
	- Remove any redundant function (e.g. Takens' Embedding)
	- Test all code and make sure it works (it should since it hasn't been changed).

This is a list of the current issues for Sphinx:

	- Failing to autodoc the modules in PD_Classification
	- Failing to autodoc the LandscapesParameterDucket class from Base.py
	- PointCloud.py is failing to autodoc from the MakeData module
	- There is no sphinx docstring documentation in the adaptivePart.py code.
